# Twilight Zone Writers

There are three main writers throughout all 5 seasons of The Twilight Zone.  This page offers a look at each of them and their individual styles.

Their styles are so unique to them (and yet still all so cohesive to the "Twilight Zone"'s writing) that if challenged, I'd be able to watch any episode and be correctly guess which of the three wrote it.
